# OWASP Top 10 for LLM Apps (2025) — Survival Guide for Builders & Blue Teams 🗿⚡

#### LLMs are the new industrial fire — brilliant, fast, and capable of burning down more than just your pride if you don’t respect them. The OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025) is the playbook every engineer, product owner, and security pro should tattoo on their mental armory.
#### This isn’t just theory; it’s a survival map for real-world AI security.

## Why this matters 🛡️

Classic OWASP taught web devs what to fear. Now, the LLM era stretches the attack surface: *prompts, embeddings, agents, RAG pipelines*. Each one is an exploitable pressure point. Miss a single gap, and your model doesn’t just hallucinate — it leaks secrets, takes destructive actions, or racks up a cloud bill that Finance will cry over. 🗿

## What’s actually new in 2025 🚨

* **Unbounded Consumption**: Goes beyond DoS — covers runaway costs, infinite loops, and compute starvation.
* **Vector & Embedding Weaknesses**: RAG pipelines are front and center; poisoning embeddings = poisoning your AI’s memory.
* **System Prompt Leakage**: Hidden “rules of the model” can now be exfiltrated and abused.
* **Excessive Agency**: LLM agents with too much freedom → the AI equivalent of giving your intern root access.

## The Top 10 — Explained with Teeth 🗿

### 1) Prompt Injection

Hackers whisper into your model’s ear, altering its behavior with crafted inputs. Can be **direct** (user prompt) or **indirect** (poisoned website, file, or RAG data). Leads to data leaks, policy bypass, or even command execution.
**Defense:** Context isolation, output schema validation, input filtering, and human approvals for high-risk actions.

### 2) Sensitive Information Disclosure

LLMs love to talk, and sometimes they overshare — PII, API keys, internal configs, or even their system prompts. This risk isn’t just a privacy issue; it’s compliance and trust on the line.
**Defense:** Token redaction, strict logging, response monitoring, and data minimization.

### 3) Supply Chain Compromise

Most AI apps rely on third-party models, APIs, datasets, or plugins. If one link is poisoned, your entire system is compromised. Imagine a poisoned dependency silently manipulating outputs.
**Defense:** Verify sources, cryptographic signing, dependency audits, and sandboxing external components.

### 4) Data & Model Poisoning

Attackers sneak malicious data into training or fine-tuning pipelines. The poisoned model can misclassify, output biased content, or act as a hidden backdoor. 🧪
**Defense:** Dataset vetting, anomaly detection, diverse data sources, and rigorous testing with “canary” inputs.

### 5) Improper Output Handling

Developers sometimes trust model outputs blindly — rendering raw HTML, executing code, or passing text directly to sensitive functions. That’s handing attackers the pen to write your exploit.
**Defense:** Always sanitize and escape outputs, use strict schemas, and never auto-execute LLM-generated code.

### 6) Excessive Agency

LLMs are increasingly wired into tools and APIs, acting as “agents.” But if permissions aren’t locked down, they can perform dangerous actions — like sending emails, modifying files, or pulling sensitive data.
**Defense:** Principle of least privilege, auditable logs, human-in-the-loop for destructive ops, and signed command flows.

### 7) System Prompt Leakage

Those hidden “master instructions” guiding the LLM? Attackers can trick models into exposing them. Once leaked, the blueprint of your safety and control layer is public. 🕵️‍♂️
**Defense:** Keep system prompts secret, detect prompt-echo attempts, and treat prompts like sensitive configs.

### 8) Vector & Embedding Weaknesses

Your RAG setup pulls from embeddings. Poison that store, and the model retrieves manipulated context — leading to misinformation, prompt injections, or subtle data manipulation.
**Defense:** Secure document ingestion, provenance checks, embedding validation, and similarity thresholds.

### 9) Misinformation

LLMs can confidently output nonsense — or worse, manipulated content. In critical domains like healthcare, finance, or news, misinformation is as dangerous as a 0-day exploit.
**Defense:** Ground responses in trusted sources, enforce citations, and build fallback modes like “I don’t know.”

### 10) Unbounded Consumption

Attackers can exploit LLM workflows with massive prompts, infinite loops, or repeated queries. The result? Out-of-control compute bills or service disruption. 🏴‍☠️
**Defense:** Rate limits, token quotas, API timeouts, and circuit breakers for runaway jobs.

---

## Why attackers love this surface 🌑

The LLM stack isn’t just one model — it’s a mix of **frontends, retrieval layers, APIs, plugins, and vector stores**. That’s a buffet of entry points. Poison one link, and you can pivot into the rest. Multimodal models (text + images) add even wilder vectors — like hiding instructions in images. For attackers, it’s an endless playground. For defenders, it’s sleepless nights. 🗿

## Case Study: The German Automotive Giant’s Chatbot XSS 🏎️💨

*From real life. Loud and clear.*

Valuation: **\~\$60B+ (2025)**

While exploring a **German automotive company’s official AI chatbot**, I tested how it processed inputs. Modern customer-facing AI is sleek, fast, and… sometimes dangerously naive.

1. **Step 1 — Innocent HTML:**

   ```html
   <fieldset><legend>hello:</legend><label for="fname">First name:</label>
   <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>
   <input type="submit" value="Submit">
   </fieldset>
   ```
   
![Car1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/628d0152-df21-4f7b-ac0e-71db94a6954a) <br/>

   Result: It rendered directly. No sanitization. Red flag 🚩.

![Car2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c99a629-eb62-49c3-bd95-49028fb6a86c) <br/>

2. **Step 2 — Malicious Payload (XSS):**

   ```html
   --><img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>
   ```

![Car3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2123ebaf-cddd-4207-9224-f9a719fb4c2d) <br/>

   Result: Executed flawlessly, popping session cookies. 🗿💥

![Car4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac319f6c-99f5-4ab8-97ef-fced5ed55cfe) <br/>

**Why this matters:**

* **Data theft:** Session hijacking in seconds.
* **Brand trust:** Imagine a customer seeing alert boxes — or worse, malware.
* **Regulation:** GDPR + Europe = lawsuit magnet.

Lesson: never trust raw LLM outputs. Sanitize everything before it hits the browser.

## Closing Thoughts — Build Paranoid, Ship Smart ⚡

LLMs reward imagination — both genius and malicious. The OWASP Top 10 for LLMs (2025) is your compass in this storm. Treat prompts like untrusted user input, keep agents on short leashes, lock down your vector stores, and test your pipelines as if you’re the attacker.

🗿 Rule of thumb: If you don’t threat model your AI, someone else will — and they won’t be on your payroll.
